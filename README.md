### Introduction
The NCAA is interested in how college football games are changing over time to determine if changes are needed to increase its popularity. The NCAA wants to start by determining the direction of defense in college football and its effect on the game. We have been contracted to analyze the last 17 years of college football data to determine if the value of defense is diminishing.
